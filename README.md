This project was intended for a company we spoke with during a school project. The project was never pursued further, but I will retain it as a historical record.

## PalmerHeating

PalmerHeating WebApp

## Quick start
Install packages:
```
meteor npm install
```
Start Meteor:
```
meteor
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in any browser.


### Client tests (todo)
Jest is used on the client to test React components.
Enzyme is used to help test, assert, manipulate, and traverse React components.

## ESLint

ESLint is used to enforce consistent styling.

Airbnb and Prettier style presets are used.

To clean the app run:
```
npm run prettier
```

This will conform files in the 'imports', 'client' and 'server' folders to the style presets.
